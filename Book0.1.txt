The sun was setting over the city of New York, casting a golden glow over the skyscrapers and bridges. A young woman named Alice was walking home from her job at a bookstore, humming a tune to herself. She loved books more than anything else in the world. She had read hundreds of them, from classics to sci-fi to romance. She dreamed of writing her own stories someday, but she never had the courage to start.

She turned a corner and saw a familiar sight: a small shop with a sign that read "Mad Hatter's Antiques". She had passed by this shop many times before, but she had never gone inside. It always looked closed and dusty, and she wondered what kind of antiques it sold. She felt a strange curiosity about it today. Maybe it was because she had just finished reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for the tenth time.

She decided to take a peek inside. She pushed the door open and stepped into the shop. It was dark and cluttered with all kinds of objects: clocks, mirrors, lamps, dolls, paintings, books and more. She felt like she had entered another world.

"Hello?" she called out. "Is anyone here?"

There was no answer. She walked further into the shop, looking around with fascination. She saw a shelf full of old books that caught her eye. She reached for one of them and pulled it out.

It was a leather-bound book with gold lettering on the cover that read "The Book of Wonder". She opened it and saw that it was blank.

She frowned in confusion. Why would someone sell a blank book? Was it some kind of joke?

She flipped through the pages and saw that they were all empty except for one.

On the last page there was a single sentence written in elegant script:

"To enter Wonderland, you must write your own story."

Alice stared at the sentence in disbelief. She wondered if it was some kind of prank or a hidden message. She looked around the shop for any clues or signs of life, but she saw none.

She felt a sudden urge to write something on the blank pages. She didn’t know why, but she felt like it was a challenge she had to accept. She searched for a pen or a pencil in the shop, but she couldn’t find any.

She remembered that she had a pen in her backpack. She took it out and opened the book again. She hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to write.

She decided to write the first thing that came to her mind:

“I wish I could go to Wonderland.”

As soon as she wrote those words, something strange happened.

The book glowed with a bright light and started to shake in her hands. She felt a pull from inside the book, as if it was trying to suck her in.

She screamed and dropped the book on the floor. She backed away from it, terrified.

She watched as the book opened by itself and a large hole appeared on its pages. The hole grew bigger and bigger until it filled the whole room.

She saw colors and shapes swirling in the hole, like a kaleidoscope. She heard voices and sounds that were familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.

She realized that it was Wonderland.

And she had just written herself into it.
